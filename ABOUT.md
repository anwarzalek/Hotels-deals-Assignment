# why Java?
First of all java is a open source programming language created by Sun Microsoft overtaken by oracle,
Its source code is available for free inside every JDK ( Java Development Kit)

besides java can run on any computer irrespective to the hardware and software dependency.
Means Java does not depend on hardware means what type of processor , RAM etc. 
Java will run on a machine which will satisfy its basic needs.

Java is fast because of JIT compiler. 
Just In Time compiler stores the repeated code in its cache memory and in byte code where repeated code is used ,
instead of loading that code again from memory JIT use it from its cache memory and safe time and space and make execution fast.

basically this is why i choosed java because it is fast,reliable and secure language besides it is the most popular language that everyones using it around the world so it has a great support when you ask for something.

# Reaching the solution
when i started developing the application i tried so hard to make it as simple as possible so first of all i thought to make an app that searches for the hotels using the provided API and started my work with logical thinking about what i need to display those information in a good manner.
and here is my logical Process steps:

1. First of all i thought of all needed requirements to make the project run propably so i downloaded and installed the platforms and the IDE that i will work on, and finally i finished the installation which was a very buggy step and i spent the most of the time on it

2. i started to think on how to get the infromations from HTML fields and start using those informations to search for the hotels i finished this step in a short time

3. on this step i started to display the JSON sheet without filteration of the search to check if i can connect probably to the API and get infromation from it

4. after checking the connection and the JSON sheet i started to use extracted infrmations from the HTML and use it as a query parameters to filter the search results and display it as JSON

5. finally i extracted the information from the JSON sheet and made a very simple UI to display the informations so i choosed to make it with texts and some spaces

Actually all my experience in java was about making android apps so i learned here alot of things in a short amount of time
so i learned how to use servlet class and how to handle the post and get requests besides it is my first time to use heroku so i downloaded the CLI and started to learn heroku commands to deploy my app successfully after hundreds of failed attempts to deploy it
it was a really great experience to learn tons of things and how to made a simple wep app like the one i finished
