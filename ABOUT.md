# why Java?
First of all java is a open source programming language created by Sun Microsoft overtaken by oracle,
Its source code is available for free inside every JDK ( Java Development Kit)
besides java can run on any computer irrespective to the hardware and software dependency.
Means Java does not depend on hardware means what type of processor , RAM etc. 
Java will run on a machine which will satisfy its basic needs.
Java is fast because of JIT compiler. 
Just In Time compiler stores the repeated code in its cache memory and in byte code where repeated code is used ,
instead of loading that code again from memory JIT use it from its cache memory and safe time and space and make execution fast.
basically this why i choosed java because it is fast,reliable and secure language besides it is the most popular language that
everyones using it around the world so it has a great support when you ask for something.
